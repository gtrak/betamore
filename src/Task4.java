/**
 * 1. Fibonacci.  A Fibonacci number is one of the set 1 1 2 3 5 8 ...
 *    where the next is just the sum of the last two.  Create an iterative
 *    function that implements fibonacci and returns the nth element.
 *    (Hint: we know the first two values, from there we can find the
 *    next, from there we can find the next, ...)
 * 2. Notice that it's equivalent to the recursive.
 * 3. Notice that there's no stackoverflow error here on large
 *    numbers.  If you haven't tried a large number on the recursive
 *    implementation, try it now.
