/**
 * 1. Using an API.  The build.gradle file includes the JSoup jar into
 *    the compile/run classpath.  It's available for you to use in
 *    your project.  Try it now! http://jsoup.org/
 * 2. Write a program using the JSoup API that downloads a web-page,
 *    extracts out all the image urls, and prints them to the console.
 *    (hint: look at the source of the webpage, 'img' tags/elements
 *    contain the information you need, with their URI under attribute 'src'.
 *    THAT should keep you busy for a while.
